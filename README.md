# globeEngage
The problem that this project aims to solve is to motivate users to engage with nature through a point system.

Currently there is a lack of an app that can encourage users to explore nature specifically for the purpose of capturing its beauty through videography, geospatial data in addition to a point system that can deliver an interactive experience as well as an encouraging factor for users.
